                Ward's, Willow and Leverett Ponds. A dual path system,
                 popular with runners and cyclists, also allows for a 
                 leisurely stroll. Olmsted designed the park as â€œa 
                 chain of picturesque fresh-water ponds, alternating
                  with attractive natural groves and meads."
