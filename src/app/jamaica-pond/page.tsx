                        Olmsted with its “great beauty in reflections and 
                        flickering half-lights.” The largest standing body of 
                        water in the Emerald Necklace, it needed few alterations 
                        to highlight its natural beauty. Olmsted preserved much 
                        of the existing vegetation and framed the pond with new 
                        trees, shrubs and paths."
